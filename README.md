# Bible Study Tool

A standalone website that interfaces with the BibleSuperSearch API for searching and reading Bible passages. This is a client-side React application that requires no backend server beyond API communication.

## Important Disclaimer

**This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with BibleSuperSearch.** This is an independent frontend application that strictly consumes the BibleSuperSearch API. BibleSuperSearch is a separate service, and this project does not provide, maintain, or support the BibleSuperSearch API itself.

If you need support for your BibleSuperSearch API installation, please visit [BibleSuperSearch Downloads](https://www.biblesupersearch.com/downloads/) to purchase a support license. BibleSuperSearch offers priority support licenses for their API and client software.

   git clone https://github.com/alephcom/bible_study.git
   cd bible_study
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Configure API URL:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and set your BibleSuperSearch API URL:
   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/api
   ```
   
   Replace `http://localhost/api` with your actual BibleSuperSearch API URL.
   
   - If your API is at `https://your-api-domain.com`, set:
     ```
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api
     ```
   
   - If running locally at `http://localhost`, set:
     ```
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/api
     ```

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Configuration

The application needs to connect to a running BibleSuperSearch API instance.

This application communicates with the BibleSuperSearch API. The API endpoints used are:

- `/api/query` - Main query endpoint for searches and passage lookups
- `/api/bibles` - Get list of available Bible versions
- `/api/books` - Get list of Bible books
- `/api/strongs` - Strong's number definitions

Note: The API also supports `/api/v2/{action}` endpoints, but versioning is not yet implemented - both routes point to the same controller.

Make sure your API base URL is correctly configured in the `.env` file.

### BibleSuperSearch API Support

If you need help with your BibleSuperSearch API installation, configuration, or troubleshooting, please purchase a support license from [BibleSuperSearch Downloads](https://www.biblesupersearch.com/downloads/). This project cannot provide support for the BibleSuperSearch API itself.

3. **Search by Keywords**: Use the "Keyword Search" tab and enter search terms
4. **Browse the Bible**: Use the "Browse" tab to navigate through books and chapters with Previous/Next buttons
5. **View Results**: Passages are displayed in a formatted, easy-to-read layout
6. **Parallel Comparison**: When multiple versions are selected, view them side-by-side with version labels
7. **Share Links**: Copy the URL to share or bookmark any passage or search result
8. **Language Support**: The interface automatically adapts to your browser's language (27 languages supported)
